# TextEditor

This is just a personal project where I am making a text editor with syntax highlighing and all that good stuff. I'm hoping it to be a simplified version of Notepad++ or slightly more advanced than notepad.exe.

# How to use
Once you've cloned the repository, open the solution folder in Visual Studio to look at and edit the code.
